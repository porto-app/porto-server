### Approach

We needed to create a back end database for our application, in order to do that we had to understand the utility necessary for the back end to provide for the front-end. We decided that each user will have a profile, the profile includes, a mandatory first name, last name, image url for profile picture, job title, location, email, and url to resume, as well as an optional middle name field, after completing those required fields, each user will be able to have up to four projects in their profile which includes a project url, a project description, a project name, and an image url to show your project.
